## 🎯 Fun Facts & Beyond

- 🧩 I thrive on tackling “unsolvable” tech puzzles and love diving into the unknown—whether it’s a new programming language, an obscure framework, or a quirky API.
- 🤝 I’m the kind of teammate who always brings a mix of creative ideas and pragmatic solutions to the table (and maybe the occasional meme).
- 🌍 I believe technology should empower and inspire, not just automate—and I’m always on the lookout for projects that make a positive impact.
- 🚴‍♂️ When I’m not coding, you might find me biking through hidden city trails, sketching out app ideas in coffee shops, or plotting my next hackathon win.
- 🦄 My secret: I treat every bug as a riddle and every project as a chance to outdo myself.
